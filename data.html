            <p>If you're concerned about how much of your data Facebook and Instagram are collecting, obviously leaving these platforms would be the fastest way to limit this. But that's not the easiest thing to do these days, especially with how much social media is integrated into our daily lives. A few simple things you can do is limit the access that these apps have to your photos and camera, and decrease the amount of photos that you upload. You can also turn off some settings for these apps, like Facebook's facial recognition tracking. Here's a list of resources to check out for more information on what you can do to decrease the data that these apps collect from you.</p>
