            <p>Knowing how Instagram can give you targeted ads based on not only your location, interests, and likes, but also based on data from third-parties, I decided to look further into how personalized my ads were. I noticed that Instagram would sometimes give me ads based on products that I looked at outside of the app, but I wasn't sure how the rest of my ads differed from others'.</p>
                
            <p>I recorded myself scrolling through my feed and asked one of my friends to do the same.</p>  
                
           <video autoplay>
                <source src="ig_ads.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                
            <p>I tend to see a lot of clothing and fashion ads, along with ads for social media apps and subscription box services. Other than following people I know, I only follow a couple fashion and clothing brands/accounts, so the ads I see make sense. For comparison, the following video is my friend's screen recording of him using Instagram.
                </p>   
            
            <video autoplay>
                <source src="jason_ig.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>    
            <p>He also follows people that he knows, several clothing brands, and a few celebrities and politicians. We live nearby and are the same age, and he sometimes sends me links to products that I end up seeing as ads on Instagram and Facebook, so I wasn't sure how much our ads would differ. Despite following clothing brands and often looking at coffee products, most of his ads were for Microsoft and various universities and grad schools. </p> 
                
            <p>We often only see our own ads, so it can be hard to tell how personal and targeted our ads really are, so if you use Instagram, feel free to take a look at what type of ads you get and compare them with what I found. </p>
