            <p>Instagram is tracking as much as it can about your personal data. Since Instagram was acquired by Facebook, Facebook collects data about you from both platforms. Whether it's tracking your face from your camera and photos, figuring out your address and phone number, or logging your likes, Instagram tracks all your behavior on the platform. According to Instagram's data policy, this inclused the "people, pages, accounts, hashtags, and groups you are connected to and how you interact with them." If you ever upload or import an address book or call log, Facebook and Instagram will collect this information from you. But Instagram doesn't stop there. Even if you don't upload photos or ever allow the app to use your camera, Instagram still logs "the types of content you engage with... the frequency and duration of you activities.. and what posts, videos and other content you view." Instagram even obtains data from the device you use, like your device IDs, bluetooth signals, IP address, and GPS location. </p>    
            <div id="graphics">
            </div>
                
            <p>So what does Instagram do with this information? Well, Facebook wants this data from Instagram for many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/technology/facebook-privacy-hearings.html"><u>reasons</u></a>, including creating <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-court-rules-users-can-sue-facebook-over-facial-recognition-technology/"><u>facial recognition templates</u></a> to identify you in photos. But one of the biggest ways that Instagram uses your data is to give you targeted advertisements. When someone or a company buys an ad on Instagram, Instgram allows them to choose an age range, specific location down to a one mile radius, and specific interests of Instagram users.</p>
            <p>I wanted to see for myself how specific Instagram's targeting could get, so I tried creating a new Instagram account about online privacy <a href="instagram.com/protectonlineprivacy"><u>@protectonlineprivacy</u></a>.</p>
                
        <p>I made several posts with information about Instagram's data policy, and also decided to do a promotion for a post that was meant to target UChicago students living in Hyde Park between the ages of 20-22. However, before Instagram let me run the promotion, it forced me to make a linked Facebook page through my Facebook account.</p>
                
        <img src="images/fbpage.png">   
                
        <p>So I went through and made the Facebook page that linked to the Instagram account.</p>  
                
          <div class="mdboxright">
        <div class="workimages">
            <img src="images/promo1.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>
            <andale class="gray">And this is what types of choices Instagram gives you when choosing a promotion audience</andale>
        </p>
     </div>
                
        <div class="mdboxleft">
        <div class="workimages">
        <img src="images/promotionpic.jpg">
        </div>
        <p><andale class="gray">This is the post that I made the promotion for</andale></p>
        </div>    
                
        <div class="mdboxright">
            <img src="images/promo2"></div>
                
        <div class="mdboxleft">
            <img src="images/promo3">
                </div>
                
        <p>When I made the promotion, I chose an age range of 20-22, with a location within a mile of UChicago's campus, and users that had an interest in categories such as university, students, and higher education. Although the promotion only ran for 2 days for $8 worth of views and there wasn't much engagement since the account was new, it seemed to have reached the targeted audience because of one comment that the post received.

                </p>
                
        <p>Because Instagram collects so much information about where you live, what types of posts you like, who you follow, and what you do with the app, it's easy for brands to have their ads shown to exactly who they want to see them, and that's how Instagram makes money. Instagram says they "don't sell you data," but they do use your data to allow other companies to choose who they want to target. </p>
                
        <p>Something else I found out about through this experiment was how much Instagram wants its users to also use Facebook. Since I had to make a Facebook page to make the Instagram promotion, I was getting more notifications on my Facebook account about the promotion than I was from Instagram. Facebook was repeatedly telling me how much engagement the Instagram post was getting and kept trying to get me to promote the same post on Facebook.
